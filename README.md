# Simulation_App

## Descprition of the App
This is a Windowds App implemented by Windows Forms application in C++/CLI. The Window Form is used for input of data necessery to simulate the performance of a queing system (M/M/n/K Model or Flow Model).

The algorithm for simulating the queing system is written in C++ using OOP paradigm.

The files of the App include the header and cpp file for the algorithm of the simulation. The input to the SimulationModels.cpp is fed through the Window Form.
The Window Form is defined in Myform.h and its functionalities in the MyForm.cpp.

## Running the App

In order to build the app you have to perform the following steps:

-Install Microsoft Visual Studio (not vs code)

-Intstall the workload of "Desktop development with C++" and ".NET desktop development"
